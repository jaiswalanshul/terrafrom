# Getting-Started-Terraform
The course was developed using version 0.12.25 of Terraform. As far as I know there are no coming changes that will significantly impact the validity of these exercise files. But I also don't control all the plug-ins, providers, and modules used by the configurations.

When you complete an exercise in the course, be sure to tear down the infrastructure. Each exercise file ends with terraform destroy. Just run that command and approve the destruction to remove all resources from AWS.

Thanks and happy automating!
